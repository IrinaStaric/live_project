## Idea
Lines and planes are basic geometric objects used to describe position and direction in space.

In two dimensions, a line can be described by a linear equation, while in three dimensions planes extend this idea to an additional dimension.

## Notes
- Lines describe one-dimensional structures.
- Planes describe flat two-dimensional surfaces in space.
- These concepts are essential for analytic geometry and linear algebra.
