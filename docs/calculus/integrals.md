# Integrals

## Idea
An integral can represent area under a curve.

## Example
$$
\int_0^1 x^2\,dx = \left[\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{3}.
$$
## Interpretation
Beyond geometry, integrals can represent accumulated quantities such as distance, mass, probability, or energy.

This makes integration a fundamental tool across mathematics, physics, and engineering.
